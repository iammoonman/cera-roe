## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server with `npm run dev`.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## .env

This project needs three string environment variables.  
`TOKEN` is a Discord bot token.  
`GUILD` is the Discord guild ID from Limited Perspective.  
`MONGO` is the connection string for the Mongo Atlas instance. If you don't have this, some dummy data will be loaded.
